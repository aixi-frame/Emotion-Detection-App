🚀 Emotion Detection Web App | Machine Learning + NLP

I’m excited to share my latest project — Emotion Detection App, a machine learning–based web application that detects emotions from text in real time.

🔍 About the Project
This app uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to classify text into six emotions:
👉 Sadness, Anger, Love, Surprise, Fear, and Joy

🛠️ Tech Stack Used

Python

NLP (TF-IDF Vectorization)

Logistic Regression (Multi-class Classification)

Scikit-learn

Streamlit (Web UI)

Joblib (Model Serialization)

✨ Key Features

Real-time emotion prediction from user input

Clean and interactive Streamlit UI

Deployed on Streamlit Cloud

End-to-end ML pipeline (training → deployment)

🌐 Live App:
